# Project Status

## Current task

- **Reference:** https://www.cloudconverge.io/custom-web-development/
- **Local target:** `custom-web-development.html`
- **State:** Complete
- **Last updated:** 2026-07-22

## Architecture

- Shared header/footer are injected through `js/header.js`, `js/footer.js`, and `js/include.js`.
- Shared CSS remains in `css/style.css` and `css/responsive.css`.
- The new page will load its dedicated stylesheet, `css/pages/custom-web-development.css`, plus page-specific JavaScript only where interaction requires it.
- HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only.

## Latest correction

- Service-card hover precedence was corrected so the visible-card reveal state no longer suppresses the upward lift.
- Hovering a service card now reveals its blue top line, lifts the complete card by 5px, and lifts its text panel by an additional 5px with a 300ms transition.
- Service-card headings use the reference semibold Poppins weight at desktop and mobile sizes.
- Statistics are no longer hidden behind an unreliable viewport reveal state.
- The four statistic icons now match the reference artwork and use the reference 55px display size.
- Desktop column widths, separators, typography, and vertical spacing were matched against the live reference measurements.

## Previous completed page

## Custom web development page

- Added `custom-web-development.html` with its dedicated `css/pages/custom-web-development.css` and `js/custom-web-development.js` files.
- Reused the shared header, contact section, and footer without duplicating their markup or CSS.
- Bundled the reference hero and six service-card images locally under `assets/images/`.
- Replicated the breadcrumb, typography, long-form introduction, six development service cards, factors grid, sliding work showcase, statistics, industries, awards, and testimonial carousel.
- Added the reference card hover lift, scroll-in reveals, draggable/autoplay testimonial loop, and directional work-carousel slide transition with reduced-motion support.
- Matched the reference desktop and 390px mobile section positions, individual service-card heights, image dimensions, and responsive typography.
- Corrected the service-card copy width to the reference 290px content measure, restoring the matching line wraps and compact card composition.
- Added the reference hover state: the complete card lifts 5px, its copy lifts an additional 5px, the shadow strengthens, and a blue 3px top accent draws across the card.
- Confirmed the first desktop card now matches the live reference at 350 × 506px, with its image and text positions within approximately 1px.

- Replicated the Services hero, product cards, Product Engineering section, ecommerce cards, Cloud Engineering section, Business Intelligence / AI cards, statistics, industries, awards, testimonials, and shared contact/footer.
- Bundled the exact reference video, section imagery, service icons, awards, and testimonial assets locally under `assets/`.
- Added the reference reveal and hover motion while preserving reduced-motion support.
- Matched the hero service shortcuts with static icons and subtle vertical separators between the four desktop items; the separators are removed in the stacked mobile grid.
- Removed reveal and full-card hover motion from the product-tools section. Only each blue `Discover More` control lifts 5px on hover, without changing color.
- Removed all entrance and hover motion from the five Product Engineering service items so their icons and copy remain static.
- Removed entrance and lift motion from the four ecommerce cards. Hovering a card now changes only its inset label from white to blue with white text.
- Removed the icon-specific hover movement and transition from all seven Cloud Engineering service items while retaining the reference section reveal.
- Added the reference 5px hover lift to each complete Cloud Engineering icon-and-copy item; the icon remains static within the moving card.
- Removed entrance and hover motion from the three BI/AI cards. Their `Discover More` controls now use the reference 153 × 38px blue button and lift 5px on hover.
- Corrected testimonial sizing to the live reference: standard holders are 400px high, the long organization holder is 502px, and flex items no longer stretch to the tallest visible review.
- Matched the reference carousel's initial desktop pair: Samuel Correns followed by Kabu Projects.
- Hardened the testimonial infinite loop with bounded dragging, transition locking, clone-range normalization, and a timeout fallback for browsers that omit `transitionend`; blank track states are no longer reachable.
- Added a draggable, autoplaying, bidirectional infinite testimonial carousel. Edge clones are created before the first movement, preventing blank cards or visible loading gaps.
- Kept all page-specific rules out of shared `style.css` and `responsive.css`.

## QA

- Desktop section boundaries at 1920px match the reference to approximately 1px through the testimonials/contact boundary.
- Mobile section boundaries at 390px track the reference closely; the hero, products, Product Engineering, BI intro, and testimonial start are within approximately 0–12px.
- Checked 1920, 1440, 1366, 1280, 1024, 768, 480, 390, and 360px responsive widths.
- Verified zero broken images, zero console errors, no remote runtime assets, no horizontal page overflow, and valid `js/services.js` syntax.
- Verified the testimonial track advances automatically with no empty slides.
